Flotr is a javascript plotting library based on the **[Prototype Javascript Framework 1.6+](http://prototypejs.org/)**.

Flotr enables you to draw **appealing graphs** in most modern browsers with an **easy to learn syntax**.

The currently supported chart types are :
  * Histograms (vertical, horizontal, stacked bars)
  * Lines (filled or not)
  * Points (scatter plots)
  * Pie chart
  * Candle sticks (and barcharts)
  * Radar chart
  * Markers (positioned text)

A **logarithmic scale** support is coming soon.

It comes with great features like legend support, negative value support, mouse tracking, selection support, zoom support, event hooks, css styling support, text included into the canvas, rotated labels, color gradients, graph title and subtitle, spreadsheet, CSV data download and much more.

Flotr is the replacement of [Plotr](http://www.solutoire.com/plotr/). **Because Plotr is deprecated, I recommend switching to Flotr**.
