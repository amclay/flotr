**Does Flotr support negative values?**
> Yes, it does. There’s an [example of a graph with negative values](http://phenxdesign.net/projects/flotr/examples/prototype/negative.html).

**Which browsers are supported?**
> Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, Chrome 1.0+ Opera 9+ and IE6+.

**How can I save the graph as an image on IE?**
> This is simply impossible at the moment, because it is drawn through the ExCanvas library which generates vector graphics (VML), and we cannot retrieve these graphics as bitmap images in a simple way.

**I found a bug, what can I do?**
> Don’t panic. First thing you do is try to fix it. Then, go to the Flotr Google Project page, and file a bug in [the issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/flotr/issues/list).

**Do you give support for Flotr?**
> We distribute Flotr ‘as is’, we do not get paid for it, but we will answer your questions. We only want you to read the docs and the FAQ before asking any question.

**My question’s still not answered, how do I contact you?**
> We do not guarantee any support. But you could try to contact us by either using the contact form on our contact page, or [post a message on the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/flotr).
